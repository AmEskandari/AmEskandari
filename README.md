## About Me
I am a PhD student in the School of Computing at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada. My research focuses on Graph Machine Learning for text and time-series data, with applications in AI-Reasoning, Multi-Variate Time-Series Imputation, Automated Diagnosis Systems, and Dialogue Systems.

## Background
Prior to my PhD, I served as a graduate research assistant at AUT. I hold an M.Sc. from AmirKabir University of Technology and a B.Sc. from IKIU, both in Electrical Engineering. During my master's, I worked on multi-variate time-series imputation using GNNs.

## Research Interests
- Geometric and Graph Machine Learning
